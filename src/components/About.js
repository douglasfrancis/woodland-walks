          <p >My name is Angelina and Iâ€™m the owner of Woodland Walks.<br/><br/>Based near Timbersbrook, Congleton, we are lucky enough to have Biddulph Valley Way and Bosley cloud on our door step.
          <br/><br/>Other than having a number of pets (Dogs, Cats & Chickens) I have worked in veterinary practices and doggy day care businesses.<br/><br/>
          We know how important it is for our precious pooches to get the attention and exercise they deserve.
